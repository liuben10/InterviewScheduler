 Feature: add events for recruiters

As a recruiter
So that I add events
I want to be able to click on a date and add events


Background: the recruiter's account already exists and there are scheduled appointments

Given the following accounts exist:
  | username              | password          | type       |  email   |
  | fluffyBunnies         | pass1234          | recruiter  |  a@b |
  | radhesh               | lamepass101       | recruiter  |  a@b |
  | nestorga              | fooPass3          | candidate  |  b@c |
  | efriesen              | secure!p@ss       | candidate  | c@d  |
  | some_cand             | hello321          | candidate  | d@e |

Scenario: Add events as recruiter
  Given I am logged in as "fluffyBunnies" with password "pass1234"
  And I am looking at "fluffyBunnies" calendar page
  When I add an event "InterviewTest1" with candidate "nestorga" starting at "2013-12-15" and ending at "2013-12-15"
  Then I should see the event "InterviewTest1" in my events table
  When I am looking at "fluffyBunnies" calendar page
  Then I should see "InterviewTest1"
