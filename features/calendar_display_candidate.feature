Feature: display a calendar of appointments for candidates

As a candidate
So that I can view my appointments with recruiters
I want to see a calendar of my appointments on my profile page

Background: the candidate's account already exists and there are scheduled appointments

Given the following accounts exist:
  | username              | password          | type       |
  | fluffyBunnies         | pass1234          | recruiter  |
  | radhesh               | lamepass101       | recruiter  |
  | nestorga              | fooPass3          | candidate  |
  | efriesen              | secure!p@ss       | candidate  |
  | some_cand             | hello321          | candidate  |

  And the following events exist:
  | recruiter_id        | name          | pending_id     | start_at | end_at |
  | fluffyBunnies   | Wrecruiter     | nestorga      | 2013-12-13   |2013-12-13   |
