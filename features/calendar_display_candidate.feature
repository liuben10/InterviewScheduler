Feature: display a calendar of appointments for candidates

As a candidate
So that I can view my appointments with recruiters
I want to see a calendar of my appointments on my profile page

Background: the candidate's account already exists and there are scheduled appointments

Given the following accounts exist:
  | username              | password          | type       |
  | fluffyBunnies         | pass1234          | recruiter  |
  | radhesh               | lamepass101       | recruiter  |
  | nestorga              | fooPass3          | candidate  |
  | efriesen              | secure!p@ss       | candidate  |
  | some_cand             | hello321          | candidate  |

  And the following appointments exist:
  | username        | type          | meet_with     | date       |
  | fluffyBunnies   | recruiter     | nestorga      | 10/03/13   |
  | fluffyBunnies   | recruiter     | efriesen      | 12/25/12   |
  | radhesh         | recruiter     | some_cand     | 03/02/14   |
  | radhesh         | recruiter     | nestorga      | 07/27/08   |
  | nestorga        | candidate     | fluffyBunnies | 10/03/13   |
  | nestorga        | recruiter     | radhesh       | 07/27/08   |
  | efriesen        | candidate     | fluffyBunnies | 12/25/12   |
  | some_cand       | candidate     | radhesh       | 03/02/14   |

  And I am on the "nestorga" candidates page
